## Women's Challenge

# **Leveraging the First Steps**

### *What is it?*

This app is creating a network to give small business owners and women entrepreneurs an outlet to communicate with mentors, facilitators, and local government. Not only will owners receive advice and helpful tips, but input from fellow owners with groups. Groups can be created to allow owners, mentors, and facilitators with similar knowledge or information to work together providing users with multiple perspectives and support that can help in developing their businesses.

### *Why this app?*

Female entrepreneurs and small business owners have been the minority in the business world for far too long. Women need to be encouraged to start businesses and then once started, to keep them. Many simply need a place to ask questions, get answers, tips, and advice when roadblocks arise. This app provides a place for women to ask questions, receive answers, and solutions to problems they never saw coming.

### *How does our app work?*

Mentors are able to give coaching and guidance to owners about the various aspects of their businesses. Facilitators can offer workshops where owners can learn new techniques and processes for running their businesses. Accessing local governments can help give owners information about what the Small Business Association (SBA) offers for their specific area.

### *Future Projections*

We see this application having long term benefits for many businesses owners and entrepreneurs.  Itâ€™s a network for people to connect and help each other. This includes guidance in the best places for starting a small business. Oklahoma City, OH is the best city, other good cities are Salt Lake City, UT, Charlotte, NC, and Tulsa, OH.
